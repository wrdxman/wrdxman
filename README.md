- Hi, Iâ€™m @wrdxman
- I have had a 25 year career in Operations and Policy management in an SAAS environment, but I have always been drawn to coding.
- I would be interested in starting a new career as an entry level programmer so that I can build this skill.
- I am currently learning Git/Github, and have been working on little projects in C++ lately.
- I am using Github as a method to organize the exercises I work on
- I can be reached at ward.xman@gmail.com
