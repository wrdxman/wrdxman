- Hi, Iâ€™m @wrdxman
- I have had a 25 year career in Operations and Policy Management in an SAAS environment in both Customer Service/Support
- and IT, but I have always been drawn to coding. My father and my older brother were/are both programmers.
- I would be interested in starting a new career as an entry level programmer so that I can build this skill.
- Around aught five, I began learning Visual Basic to create macros in the Microsoft Office suite. I wrote a few
- little programs like an Excel Soduko game, and various math tools, then created a tool for the
- Oregon Department of Transportation that was to collect performance data and measure process improvements.
- In 2013 I went back to school full-time at Lane Community College to work on an Associates of Applied Science in
- Computer Programming, and I took classes in JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS and Java. I didn't finish that degree.
- I was working full time and had three kids under 12 years old at home at the time...
- In 2018 I had the opportunity to go back to school at University of Oregon and got my Bachelors or Science
- in Advertising. While there I studied Python.
- I am currently learning Git/Github, and have been working on little projects in C++ lately.
- I want to use Github as a method to organize the exercises I work on rather than lose them to obscurity as I have in the past.
- I can be reached at ward.xman@gmail.com
